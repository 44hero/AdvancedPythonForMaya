# Custom Scene Plugins

## Overview

In this project, we'll be creating two plugins to learn about creating objects for our scene

* Custom Transform

    This will teach us how to make a custom node for the scene and an accompanying 
    Attribute Editor template.
    
    These custom transforms can be very useful for organizing your scene and finding assets
    quickly.
    
* Custom Locator

    We'll build on what we've learned from the Custom Transform and make our own locator shapes.
    
    We'll learn how to draw objects to the viewport using Viewport 2 with the ability to extend
    the plugin to support multiple shapes.
